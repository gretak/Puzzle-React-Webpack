**TODO list:**
- 1.Refactor - ES6 and ES5 mix in the code
- 3.Change or get rid of the navigation
- 5.Use lifecycle events in the app
- 6.Update share button to have correct title and the image (facebook developers)

From Matt:
7.Add instructions
10.DRY - with router components (containers) - two containers created
